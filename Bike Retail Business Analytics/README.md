# Bike Retail Business Analytics

**Project Overview**  
This project applies analytics to a bicycle retail business to extract meaningful insights from transaction data. We performed analyses including change-over-time trends, cumulative and performance evaluation, segmentation of customers and products.

We created **Customer Reports** and **Product Reports** to help the company identify high-value customers, track sales trends, monitor product performance, and make data-driven business decisions. The project demonstrates practical solutions for revenue growth, improved marketing targeting, and inventory optimization. Key SQL functions were used to implement these analyses efficiently.

## Analysis Framework
